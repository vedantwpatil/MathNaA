\begin{equation}
	\int_\alpha^\beta f'x \, dx=f(\beta)-f(\alpha)
\end{equation}
We can use the fundamental theorem of calculus to say that 
$\int_2^3 x^2 \, dx = \frac{3^3}{3} - \frac{2^3}{3}=\frac{19}{3}$.
Also note that $\displaystyle \int_2^3 x^2 \, dx=\frac{3^3}{3}-\frac{2^3}{3}=\frac{19}{3}$.

 We can also give this equation its own line

 \[
	 \int_2^3 \, dx = \frac{3^3}{3} - \frac{2^3}{3} = \frac{19}{3}.
 \]

That was how to write integrals and exponents

This is now how to write summations and for my calc 3 (Series and Sequences) class


Also note that $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty$
