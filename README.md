# Math Notes and Animations 

This repository contains notes for math classes from statistics and on

### How I Made Them

Using a text editor called neovim, I write LaTex code to compile into pdfs which help me get a better understanding of the work I do as well as look better. 

I used a plugin called VimTex to edit the latex files and used Zathura to view the pdf's which would be compiled. Learning vim has been a bit of a struggle but I am looking to remap my brain to better understand the motions.

### Animations 

Using a existing library called manim, I create animations using a animation engine created by the youtuber 3Blue1Brown. I have yet to fully learn this and look to get a better understanding of it in time because I feel that I could potentially create some really interesting things. 

### What I Hope to Learn

I hope that by doing this I will get a more intutive understanding of math and am able to do become more passionate about the field.
